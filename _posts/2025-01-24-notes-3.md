## Electronic Mail (Email)

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to send emails. It is a text-based protocol that uses port 25. It is a client-server protocol, where the client sends the email and the server receives it.

MINE (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is used to send attachments with emails. It is a standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs.

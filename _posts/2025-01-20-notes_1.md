## Introduction to Computer Networks

This series of notes will have a comprehensive understanding of Computer Networks and how they work.

Networks are best understood as a mountain of subparts. There are two main models: ISO/OSI model, and the TCP/IP (Transmission control protocol, Internet Protocol) model. We focus on the TCP/IP model.

**The TCP/IP model** is:-

| Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application Layer | This is the topmost layer where users interact with network services through applications |
| Transport Layer | The transport layer ensures reliable data transfer between devices. |
| Network Layer| This layer is responsible for routing and forwarding data between devices on different networks. |
| Data link Layer| The data link layer ensures reliable communication between devices on the same local network. |
| Physical Layer| Transmission of Raw binary data over the physical medium |

In detail:

#### Application Layer

The Application layer is where the users interact directly with the network services via an application. Its an interface between users software and the network. Examples of some protocols are:

- **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol for web
- **SMTP**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for email
- **DNS**: Domain Name System for domain names

#### Transport Layer

The Transport layer ensures reliable data transfer between different devices. Here, we think more on the data aspect. It breaks data into segments, manages error detection and correction, and controls the flow of data. Examples are:

- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol for reliable data transfer.
- **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol for unreliable but fast and connectionless data transfer.

#### Network Layer

The Network layer is responsible for routing and forwarding data between devices on different networks. It ensures that data reaches the intended destination. Examples are:

- **IP**: Internet Protocol for addressing and routing packets.
- **ICMP**: Internet Control Message Protocol for error reporting and diagnostics.

#### Data Link Layer

The Data Link layer is responsible for node-to-node communication and ensures reliable data transfer over the physical medium. It handles MAC (Media Access Control) and framing. Examples are:

- **Ethernet**: A widely used protocol for wired networks.
- **Wi-Fi (802.11)**: A protocol for wireless communication.
- **PPP**: Point-to-Point Protocol for direct connections between two nodes.

#### Physical Layer

The Physical layer deals with the actual transmission of raw data bits over physical hardware such as cables, radio waves, and fiber optics. It defines hardware specifications, signaling, and data encoding. Examples include:

- **Fiber Optic Cables**: High-speed data transmission medium.
- **Copper Cables (Ethernet, Coaxial, Twisted Pair)**: Common wired networking media.
- **Radio Waves (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular)**: Wireless communication methods.

What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is an infrastructure/system that facilitates the communication (information sharing) across computers/digital devices. Infrastructure includes communications devices, transmission media, and protocols.

**Basic Network Terminologies**

- **Client**: A device that requests resources or services from a server.
- **Server**: A device that provides resources or services to a client.
- **Peer**: A device that can act as either a client or a server.
- **End-hosts**: Both clients and servers.
- **Switch**: A device that connects multiple networks, forwarding data packets between them.
- **Router**: A device that connects multiple networks, forwarding data packets between them, and is used to route packets between networks.
- **Protocol**: A set of rules and standards used for communication between devices.
- **Segment**: A unit of data that is transmitted over a network.
- **Packet**: A formatted unit of data that is transmitted over a network.
- **Frame**: A formatted unit of data that is transmitted over a network at the data link layer.
- **Delay**: The time it takes for data to travel from one device to another.
- **Latency**: The time it takes for data to travel from one device to another, including any processing time.
- **Bandwidth**: The amount of data that can be transmitted over a network per unit of time.
- **Throughput**: The amount of data that is actually transmitted over a network per unit of time.
- **Loss**: The amount of data that is not successfully transmitted over a network.
- **Burst**: A short period of high data transmission volume.
- **Jitter**: The variation in delay between packets in a stream of data.

**Network and Communication Bytes**

The following table shows the different units used in computing and networking:

| Unit | Meaning | Equivalent in Bytes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kB | Kilobyte (decimal) | 1000 bytes |
| KiB | Kibibyte (binary) | 1024 bytes |
| kb | Kilobit (decimal) | 1000 bits (125 bytes) |
| Kib | Kibibit (binary) | 1024 bits (128 bytes) |

The main difference between the two systems is that the decimal system is based on powers of 10, while the binary system is based on powers of 2. This means that 1 kilobyte (KB) in the decimal system is equal to 1000 bytes, while 1 kilobyte (KiB) in the binary system is equal to 1024 bytes. Similarly, 1 kilobit (Kb) in the binary system is equal to 1024 bits, while 1 kilobit (kb) in the decimal system is equal to 1000 bits.

### Networks and Protocols

**Key Aspects of Networking Protocols**

- **Syntax**: Defines the format and structure of messages.
- **Semantics**: Explains the meaning of each message and the procedures for exchanging information.
- **Sequence/Timing**: Specifies the order and timing of message exchanges.

**Key Design Principles**

- **Robustness Principle**: Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept.
- **Layering Principle**: Layer N at the destination receives an exact copy of the message sent by Layer N at the source. All headers and modifications added by lower layers at the source must be removed by lower layers at the destination.
- **End-to-End Principle**: The network remains stateless, with only the end-hosts managing state.

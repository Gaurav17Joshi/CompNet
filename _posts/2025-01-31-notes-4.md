## Transport Layer

Why is it a separate layer, what kinds of protocols, what kind of services they should give.

They protocols now, will be services that the os provides, a bit lower level than application layer protocols. It is above the ip layer (network layer).


### Key services Understanding

Should provide an end to end delivery of data, but also gives some other services like reliability, flow control etc. 

What is end-to-end delivery?

End-to-end delivery is the process of sending data from one point to another.

IP address comes up at the network layer, what happens is that for different processes in a client has same ip address for different processes (say a browser and a tcpreplay). So, we require multiplexing and demulitplexing, and here the transport layer comes in, to send the data to correct process, despite the same ip address (End to End delivery).

A socket when written, we pass into it 3 params:-
- soc.AF_INET (address family)
- soc.SOCK_STREAM (socket type)
- soc.IPPROTO_TCP (protocol) what exact data is it trying to pick.

When a socket is opened it creates an identity at the transport layer, only the ip address is going out.
(Socket (a file descriptor) connects application to transport)

The switches seee the ethernet header to send the data further. The router uses the datalink layer twice, once up and once down. Based on the number of router etc, it gets diff time. Here networ= 3, transport layer 2, datalink layer 6, application = 1.

The os has multiple applications, and the transport layer (os- transport to physical) we need individual identifiers, as the route is common for all. So demultiplex if you are getting data to diff applications, and multiplex if you are sender. So, the port number for diff applications are different (it becomes a transport layer identifier). 

Segment is the data in transport layer (PDU: protocol data unit), for udp segment also called datagram.

Each layer has invariance, and the transport layer invariance is not on PDU, but is a property of horizontal communication (not vertical), the peer should recieve the same. 


**Multiplesin Demultiplexing**


**Connectionless demux**

Say a pc connects to server, we need a source port: 9157, and destination port: 6428 port, to send. So, how do we know the destination port?? The port is a standard number when we are running a server, for a client it does not matter. 

Standard port = stricty reserved (<1024), extended authorised (<44k) is and after 264 k is non standard.

This ensures that the client does not have to worry which port to send. Port number is for a protocol not a packet (V important)

**Connection oriented demux**

Tcpconnection is identified by a 4tuple (essential at socket level):-
- source ip address 
- source port
- destination ip address
- destination port

The layer below extends this to a 5 tuple with protocol. This field is also imp to multiplex, demultiplex. 


### UDP


UDP: Only end to end packet delivery (multiplexity demux), but not concerned over the reliability, flow control etc. It has a checksum which checks whether the data is lost or not.

- best effort service: 
- connectionless: no handshaking between UDP sender, reciever.
- Message/datagram

UDP usage:-
- HTTP3 uses UDP, but HTTP2 uses TCP.
- DNS
- 

Put: Udp header image

What checksum does? It sums up the bits, and if the sum is not correct, it is lost. It is a checksum because it is only checking if the data is lost or not. It is not checking if the data is corrupted or not. 

Full method:-

I keep the data as sequence of 16 bit integers, we keep adding these parts, and then take a ones compliment. If there is a carry, we add it again as a wraparound.

Why ones compliment?? For principle of robustness "best careful in what you send", we want to make stuff easy for the reciever, after doing 1s compliment, the reciever will just have to add.

Note: We do not just compute, we also add a psuedo header to the data (these are from the layer below). The psuedo header is:- (These come from the IP layer below, Violation of IP!!!)
- Source IP header
- Destination IP header
- Packet Length
- Protocol type
- Reserved Field

There is a violation of layering principle, but it has robustness. 12 Bytes in ipv4, and ipv6 will have 12 + 4*3*2 = 48 bytes.

Why is it robust?? As we want the destination and source are also correct (network layer says the packet is for you, but it is not for you)

Same in TCP also.

Note: UDP is one to many like a broadcast, still the destination address is the respective recievers. 

### TCP 

Transport layer protocol (It has a lot of variants but the fundaments remain the same). TCP acts as a stream of data, both sender and reciever have memory wrt to the data (helps in recovery, as refetch possible). 

Does: 3 Prinicples No loss, No corruption (Error recovery), Sequence (Ordered data)

Principles for reliable comms:-
- No loss
- No corruption (Error recovery)
- Sequence (Ordered data)

Some characteristics:
- **Point to point**: TCP is a unicast protocol, establishing a direct connection between two endpoints, unlike UDP which can be used for broadcasting.
- **Reliable, in-order byte stream**: Ensures that all data is received accurately and in the order it was sent, providing mechanisms for error checking and correction.
- **Full duplex state**: Allows simultaneous two-way communication, similar to UDP, enabling both endpoints to send and receive data at the same time.
- **Pipelined**: Supports sending multiple packets before needing an acknowledgment for the first one, enhancing throughput and efficiency.
- **Connection Oriented**: Establishes a formal connection setup and teardown process, ensuring reliable communication between endpoints.
- **Flow Controlled**: Manages data flow to prevent overwhelming the receiver, adjusting the pace of data transmission based on network conditions and receiver capabilities.
- **Congestion Controlled**: Incorporates mechanisms to detect network congestion and adjust the data transmission rate to avoid packet loss and ensure smooth data flow.

UDP header is of 64 bits, but TCP header can be varaibe = 5*32 + n*32


Put image of tcp header 

**Components of TCP Header**

1. **Source Port (16 bits)**: Identifies the sending port.
2. **Destination Port (16 bits)**: Identifies the receiving port.
3. **Sequence Number (32 bits)**: Used to ensure data is received in order.
4. **Acknowledgment Number (32 bits)**: Indicates the next expected sequence number.
5. **Data Offset (4 bits)**: Specifies the size of the TCP header. 4 is enough, as every thing is also of 4 bits multiples.
6. **Reserved (3 bits)**: Reserved for future use, must be zero.
7. **Flags (9 bits)**: Contains control flags like SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.
8. **Window Size (16 bits)**: Specifies the size of the sender's receive window.
9. **Checksum (16 bits)**: Used for error-checking the header and data.
10. **Urgent Pointer (16 bits)**: If the URG flag is set, this indicates the position of urgent data.
11. **Options (Variable bits)**: May contain options like maximum segment size.

Data is of size 4 GB (as sequence no is 32 bits $2^{32}$). TCP has exact 8 flags. R: reset, S: syn, A: acknowlegement , F: finish (i am done), P: push (It is quite common, and the push is for the entire segment not the data in the segment??), U: urgent (It is to tell what info in the data is critical, a 16 bit pointer is required for where the critical data ends, it then begins after TCP options), C: congestion control, E: ECN.

Q. what is this sequence?? where is the memory??

FTP had a separate control channel and data channel , here only data channel.

Q. Where is the data length info ??? That comes from the pseudo header, the packet length from the Ip header! That is why the pseudo header is critical. UDP had messages not a stream, it has a header.



### Connection Management:

Ping vs CM (ping only worries about the host), Connection management does - 


















### TCP packet loss:-

q. How to set TCP timeout value?
If data acknowledgement does not come for some time, assume data loss. Estimate using Sample RTT using a
smooting average. There is a good algo to do the same. 

G = clock granulaarity, (I may have a mili sec clock (now nano sec clocks), then i will have to take G as a factor). 

The algorithm is a smooting average of the RTT.



When we have RTO less than 1 sec, then it is put to 1 sec, but now systems have changed, and this can be too much of a burden. 


**TCP Fast retransmit**

(Put image)

If 4 packets are sent and the 2nd is lost, then 3 later ones will be duplicate, so we should already retransmit without waiting for timeout. If multiple duplicate acks, do immediate retransmit. 

Why 3? If we reduce to 1, as data may be duplicate, out of order, and some acks might be duplicate, hense after a good amount of experimentation, we got the window size of 3. 

Why is TCP Reliable? As data loss is acknowleged and corrected. 


### TCP Flow control

When you donot have space in your TCP socket reciever buffer, the sender should not send the data. 

The reciever contorls the sender so sender wont overflow reciever buffer, by using recieve window. With every ack, the recieve window (rwnd) is updated. Just this alone would not work, as when we reach zero, when will the sender send data next?? Then when the buffer is again emptied, same ack has to be sent. (So, system can always have one duplicate ack!!) or b. sender can aggresively probe for window size. 

But for sending even small data, we have overheads which are as big as the data, so sender is now inefficient. 
- Silly window syndrome
- Tinygram (Nagles algo: The sender delays sending data until reciever is free enough, but this is not good for streaming services)



Q. Is this buffer for the entire device/system??





















## Extras

Note:- the headers are ethernet-Ip-tcp-http, and this is opp to the tcp/ip (datalink-network-transport-application)

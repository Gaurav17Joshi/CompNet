## Transport Layer

Why is it a separate layer, what kinds of protocols, what kind of services they should give.

They protocols now, will be services that the os provides, a bit lower level than application layer protocols. It is above the ip layer (network layer).


### Key services Understanding

Should provide an end to end delivery of data, but also gives some other services like reliability, flow control etc. 

What is end-to-end delivery?

End-to-end delivery is the process of sending data from one point to another.

IP address comes up at the network layer, what happens is that for different processes in a client has same ip address for different processes (say a browser and a tcpreplay). So, we require multiplexing and demulitplexing, and here the transport layer comes in, to send the data to correct process, despite the same ip address (End to End delivery).

A socket when written, we pass into it 3 params:-
- soc.AF_INET (address family)
- soc.SOCK_STREAM (socket type)
- soc.IPPROTO_TCP (protocol) what exact data is it trying to pick.

When a socket is opened it creates an identity at the transport layer, only the ip address is going out.
(Socket (a file descriptor) connects application to transport)

The switches seee the ethernet header to send the data further. The router uses the datalink layer twice, once up and once down. Based on the number of router etc, it gets diff time. Here networ= 3, transport layer 2, datalink layer 6, application = 1.

The os has multiple applications, and the transport layer (os- transport to physical) we need individual identifiers, as the route is common for all. So demultiplex if you are getting data to diff applications, and multiplex if you are sender. So, the port number for diff applications are different (it becomes a transport layer identifier). 

Segment is the data in transport layer (PDU: protocol data unit), for udp segment also called datagram.

Each layer has invariance, and the transport layer invariance is not on PDU, but is a property of horizontal communication (not vertical), the peer should recieve the same. 


**Multiplesin Demultiplexing**


**Connectionless demux**

Say a pc connects to server, we need a source port: 9157, and destination port: 6428 port, to send. So, how do we know the destination port?? The port is a standard number when we are running a server, for a client it does not matter. 

Standard port = stricty reserved (<1024), extended authorised (<44k) is and after 264 k is non standard.

This ensures that the client does not have to worry which port to send. Port number is for a protocol not a packet (V important)

**Connection oriented demux**

Tcpconnection is identified by a 4tuple (essential at socket level):-
- source ip address 
- source port
- destination ip address
- destination port

The layer below extends this to a 5 tuple with protocol. This field is also imp to multiplex, demultiplex. 


### TCP and UDP

UDP: Only end to end packet delivery (multiplexity demux), but not concerned over the reliability, flow control etc. It has a checksum which checks whether the data is lost or not.

- best effort service: 
- connectionless: no handshaking between UDP sender, reciever.
- Message/datagram

UDP usage:-
- HTTP3 uses UDP, but HTTP2 uses TCP.
- DNS
- 

What checksum does? It sums up the bits, and if the sum is not correct, it is lost. It is a checksum because it is only checking if the data is lost or not. It is not checking if the data is corrupted or not. 

Full method:-

I keep the data as sequence of 16 bit integers, we keep adding these parts, and then take a ones compliment. If there is a carry, we add it again as a wraparound.

Why ones compliment?? For principle of robustness "best careful in what you send", we want to make stuff easy for the reciever, after doing 1s compliment, the reciever will just have to add.

Note: We do not just compute, we also add a psuedo header to the data (these are from the layer below). The psuedo header is:- (These come from the IP layer below, Violation of IP!!!)
- Source IP header
- Destination IP header
- Packet Length
- Protocol type
- Reserved Field

There is a violation of layering principle, but it has robustness. 12 Bytes in ipv4, and ipv6 will have 12 + 4*3*2 = 48 bytes.

Why is it robust?? As we want the destination and source are also correct (network layer says the packet is for you, but it is not for you)














## Extras

Note:- the headers are ethernet-Ip-tcp-http, and this is opp to the tcp/ip (datalink-network-transport-application)

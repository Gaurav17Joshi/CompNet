## Understanding HTTP (Application Layer Protocol)

### How Webpages Are Delivered to Us
- Webpages are accessed using a **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**, which includes both the **location** of the resource and the **protocol** to retrieve it.
- **Standard Ports**:
  - HTTP: `80`
  - HTTPS: `443`

### Structure of a URL
A URL typically consists of the following components:
- **Protocol**: The method of communication (e.g., `http`, `https`).
- **Authority/Host Name**: The domain name or IP address of the server.
- **Port**: The port number (optional, defaults to `80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS).
- **Path**: The specific resource or file being requested.
- **Parameters**: Data passed in the query string (useful for tasks like web scraping or interactive pages).
- **Anchor**: A fragment identifier pointing to a specific section of the resource.

### URL vs. URI
> **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A broader term that identifies resources; URLs are a subset of URIs.
> URIs do not necessarily include protocols.

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- **Invented by**: Tim Berners-Lee.
- **Definition**: A protocol for transferring hypertext documents (e.g., HTML pages) between clients and servers.
- **Hypertext**: Text containing embedded links to other documents or resources.

HTTP is the Web's application layer protocol. It is a stateless protocol, meaning that each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it.

> Till 2016, it used TCP for the transport layer protocol, but now can be used on top of any other protocol.

HTTP has a thing called RFC (Request for Comments) which is a document that describes the details of the protocol. It has changed over time, and the latest version is HTTP/3.0.

### HTTP Request Message Format
(Syntax and Semantics)

An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (like a web browser) to a server to request a specific resource or perform an action. The request message is structured into three main parts:

1. **Request Line/ Start Line**: Contains the request method, the URL, and the HTTP version.
2. **Headers**: Contains additional information about the request (e.g., the user agent, the host, the content type).
3. **Body**: Contains data sent by the client (e.g., form data, file uploads).

#### Start Line

> Important aspects:
> - Only the method is case sensitive, the rest is not.
> - Same major numbers are backward compatible, but different major numbers could be not, both server and client need to be on the same version.

### HTTP Methods

| Method   | Version | Description                                                                 |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GET**  | 0.9     | Requests data from a specified resource.                                     |
| **POST** | 1.1     | Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.                        |
| **PUT**  | 1.1     | Uploads a representation of the specified resource.                          |
| **DELETE**| 1.1    | Deletes the specified resource.                                              |
| **HEAD** | 1.1     | Same as GET but only returns the headers.                                    |
| **OPTIONS**| 1.1   | Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports.                           |
| **TRACE**| 1.1     | Echoes the received request so that a client can see what changes were made. |
| **CONNECT**| 1.1   | Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.              |
| **PATCH**| 2.0     | Applies partial modifications to a resource.                                 |

### Safe and Idempotent Methods

| Method   | Safe | Idempotent |
|----------|------|------------|
| **GET**  | Yes  | Yes        |
| **POST** | No   | No         |
| **PUT**  | No   | Yes        |
| **DELETE**| No  | Yes        |
| **HEAD** | Yes  | Yes        |
| **OPTIONS**| Yes| Yes        |
| **TRACE**| Yes  | Yes        |
| **CONNECT**| No | No         |
| **PATCH**| No   | No         |

> **Difference between POST and PUT:**
> - **POST** is used to create a new resource, while **PUT** is used to update an existing resource.

### Safe Methods
> Safe methods have (whether the server side changes or not):
> 1. No side effects
> 2. No change in server state
> 3. Can be cached and pre-fetched

### Idempotent Methods
> Idempotent methods have (whether the user returns changes or not):
> 1. Same result no matter how many times it is called
> 2. No change in server state
> 3. Necessary for fault tolerance

HTTP is "stateless", but it does not feel so, as we have cookies and sessions to maintain the state. HTTP wants the server to be stateless, but the client can maintain the state.

### Cookies
> A cookie is a small piece of data (txt file) stored on the client's computer by the web server. It is sent back to the server with each subsequent request, allowing the server to identify the client and maintain session state.

The cookies are in a session, and the session is maintained by the server. The session is maintained by the server, and the server sends the session id to the client, and the client sends the session id to the server. This is stored for a short duration as it is not secure. It has a lot of security vulnerabilities. They keep the information of what you are doing on the server and the server can keep track of what you are doing. This is used to give ads, etc.

#### 3rd Party Cookies
> These are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, a website that embeds a YouTube video may set a cookie on your browser.

## HTTP Connections

There are two types of connections in HTTP:
1. **Persistent Connection**: The client and server maintain the connection after the initial request/response, allowing multiple requests/responses to be sent over the same connection.
2. **Non-Persistent Connection**: The connection is closed after each request/response, requiring a new connection to be established for each subsequent request/response. (Old HTTP). They do ensure that only when required, the connection is established, but now if 10 objects are to be fetched, 10 connections are to be established.

**Web Performance Metric**: Response Time

### RTT: Round Trip Time
> Time taken for a packet to go from client to server and back to client.

For non-persistent connection, the RTT is:
- 2RTT + File Transmission Time
- For n objects to be fetched, it is n*(2RTT + File Transmission Time)

For persistent connection, the RTT is:
- RTT + File Transmission Time
- For n objects to be fetched, it is RTT + n*(RTT + File Transmission Time)
